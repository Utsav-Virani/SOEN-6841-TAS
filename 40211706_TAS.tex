\section{Introduction}
Project management operates as a dynamic "living system" within the broader "autopoietic organization" of a company, following its intricate internal dynamics to ensure project success. At its core are project managers who, through a unique language comprising technical-operative modality and mindset, navigate both Adaptive and Predictive project lifecycles. As noted by Akbar Azwir, external factors like government decisions can significantly impact projects, necessitating a focus on building strong project resilience \cite{Lorenzo_Daniele}.\\

In this rapidly evolving project management landscape, the traits and behaviors of effective project managers emerge as critical factors influencing project outcomes. This study delves into the essential habits that contribute to project management success, recognizing that organizations must adapt to unprecedented challenges and opportunities. The exploration includes habits such as effective communication, strategic decision-making, planning acumen, risk management proficiency, stakeholder engagement, and overall project execution prowess. By unraveling the intricacies of project management within the context of organizational dynamics, the research aims to shed light on these habits that empower project managers to navigate crises successfully and deliver projects effectively.

\subsection{Motivation}
In the age of disruptive technologies, global connectivity, and changing customer expectations, project management is no longer merely imperative but rather a strategic necessity. This research intends to reveal the habits responsible for the success of projects so that they can be used to guide novice project managers while helping organizations enhance their project management.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
Project management is a key element determining organizational success, but the specific behaviors that typify successful project managers are ambiguous. These habits are not precisely known resulting in possible disagreements and poor leadership that will not offer proper risk avoidance procedures. The importance of clarity on such key habits cannot be overemphasized in a dynamically changing business environment. The purpose of this study is to address the gap in existing knowledge, which is critical for improving current project management methods that are aligned with the changing needs of modern projects. These results will be of much value to the organizations that aim for successful project outcomes and individual project managers.


\subsection{Objective}
This research seeks to analyze and document the habits of successful project managers systematically. This way we hope to bring out the skills and behavior that make them good leaders. This study is designed to assist upcoming and accomplished project managers in acquiring practical lessons that can help formulate their professional growth plan as well as reform project management strategy in the organizations. In essence, the study intends to participate in a larger debate on what makes for effective project management, thereby serving individual professionals, teams, and organizations seeking better outcomes.\\\\

\section{Background Material}

\subsection{Interpersonal Skills and Communication in Project Management}
Effective communication and interpersonal skills are not just supplementary but central to the success of project management. These skills are crucial for establishing and maintaining positive relationships with team members, stakeholders, and clients, which are fundamental traits for success in this field \cite{Interpersonal_skills}.\\\\
Effective communication involves not only conveying information but also actively listening and understanding the needs and feedback of others. Project managers with strong interpersonal skills can effectively manage complex team dynamics, resolve conflicts, and ensure clear communication, which is vital for project cohesion and success. Emotional intelligence, which encompasses self-awareness, empathy, and social skills, further enhances a project manager's ability to lead effectively \cite{Warner_Mark}.\\

\subsection{Project Leadership and Team Building}
Effective leadership in project management goes beyond mere oversight of tasks. It involves inspiring, guiding, and mentoring team members. Successful project managers understand the strengths of each team member and align them with project objectives.\\
\\This approach not only enhances individual performance but also fosters a sense of belonging and purpose within the team. Leaders who invest in team development create a culture of continuous improvement and learning that is crucial for adapting to changing project demands. Strong team leadership ensures that each member is engaged and contributes to the project's success in a meaningful way\cite{Project_Management}.


\subsection{Adaptability and Problem-Solving}
In today's world, project management is constantly evolving, which means that those who are successful in this field need to have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to adapt quickly to new challenges. This could be due to technological advances, changes in market conditions, or any obstacles that arise within a project. \\\\It's not enough for project managers to simply change their plans; they need to do it efficiently and effectively to limit disruptions and maintain the project's momentum. To solve problems in this context, managers often need to think creatively and come up with innovative solutions that work within the project's constraints.\cite{Project_Management_Leadership}


\subsection{Ethical Decision-Making and Integrity}
Integrity and ethical decision-making are fundamental to the long-term success of projects and the reputation of the managing organization. Project managers often face a variety of ethical dilemmas, ranging from resource allocation to stakeholder engagement and conflict of interest scenarios. \\\\It is crucial for project managers to make decisions that adhere to a strong ethical framework, as this is essential for maintaining stakeholder trust and ensuring project sustainability. Ethical principles and their practical application in diverse project environments have gained increasing attention, underscoring the need for managers to be well-versed in this aspect of project management\cite{Project_Management_Techniques}.\\\\

\section{Critical thinking}
\begin{itemize}
\item How did using a mixed-methods approach improve the validity and reliability of identifying successful project manager habits, and could alternative or additional methodologies have yielded different insights?
\item What criteria were used to determine the effectiveness of certain habits in project management? How were biases controlled when analyzing personal interactions and communication styles?
\item What is the extent to which the findings of this study can be applied to project managers in different industries and geographical locations, given the sample size and diversity?
\item How does the study address the impact of rapidly evolving project management tools and methodologies on the habits of successful project managers?
    \item How were adaptability and change management evaluated in the study as essential characteristics for successful project management?\\\\
\end{itemize}

\section{Methods \& Methodology}
\subsection{Research Approach}
The study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative research methodologies to gain a deeper understanding of the habits that distinguish successful project managers. By utilizing statistical analysis and in-depth qualitative insights, the study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of these habits.
\subsection{Behavioral Management Analysis}
Project managers need to avoid certain habits such as micromanaging, letting tasks pile up, using defense mechanisms, and criticizing employees publicly. Instead, they should adopt effective habits such as personal interactions, planning, prioritizing, staying organized, and giving preference to individuals over processes and tools. Other important habits include being open to communication, maintaining a comfortable presence, problem-solving, delegating tasks, communicating, seeking knowledge, and being adaptable to change\cite{Patterns}.

\subsection{Qualitative Analysis}
the research points out an important habit prevalent among effective project managers: regularly re-evaluating and refreshing their methods and approaches, especially when they become commonplace or less impactful. This habit of self-evaluation and adaptability demonstrates the project managers’ proactive approach to enhancing project engagement and maintaining productivity. These habits, derived from in-depth interviews with project managers, emphasize the need for continuous personal development and adaptability in project management. The study underscores adaptability and proficient communication as essential traits for successful project leadership\cite{Patterns}.

\end{figure}




% \subsection{Ethical Considerations}
% In conducting interviews and case studies, we will strictly adhere to ethical considerations such as informed consent, confidentiality, and the right to withdraw. This aligns with the ethical leadership traits crucial for successful project management\cite{Project_Management_Techniques}.
\subsection{Data Analysis}
Both quantitative and qualitative data sources will be analyzed to identify patterns and commonalities in the habits of successful project managers. This analysis will be crucial in developing a comprehensive understanding of the key factors that contribute to project management success.


\section{Results Obtained}
\subsection{Under what conditions:}
The study revealed that specific circumstances had a significant impact on the efficiency of project managers.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Highly Collaborative Environments: Project managers were most successful in teams where open communication and collaboration were fostered, especially in those with a strong culture of trust and mutual respect.
    \item Dynamic and Changing Project Scenarios: In fast-paced and ever-changing work environments, project managers who possess exceptional adaptability and problem-solving skills are highly valued. These individuals can quickly and efficiently modify plans and strategies as needed, allowing them to excel and achieve success even in the face of frequent changes. Their capacity to navigate dynamic situations with ease enables them to lead their teams with confidence and produce exceptional outcomes\cite{relationship_between_project_manage}.
    \item Ethical and Transparent Cultures: In organizations with a strong ethical framework and clear communication channels, projects led by managers who prioritize ethical decision-making and transparency tend to have higher success rates. This is because such managers are more likely to foster a culture of trust and accountability, which in turn leads to better collaboration and more effective problem-solving. Additionally, by being transparent about their decision-making processes and involving team members in important decisions, these managers can help to ensure that everyone is aligned and working towards the same goals. Ultimately, this approach can lead to better outcomes for the organization as a whole, as well as increased job satisfaction and engagement among team members. Projects led by managers who prioritize ethical decision-making and transparency tend to have higher success rates, especially in organizations with a strong ethical framework and clear communication channels\cite{Project_Management_Techniques}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Constrains}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Resource Limitations: One of the most typical problems for a project manager is trying to succeed under restricted resources. For example, this includes lack of funds, scarcity of human capital, and shortage of time. Resource management and creative problem-solving in the face of those limitations are important characteristics of effective project management\cite{relationship_between_project_manage}.
    \item Communication Barriers: Communication barriers may be caused by diverse team compositions, especially in remote or international projects. Therefore, project managers need to master the communication techniques to ensure these gaps are bridged\cite{Warner_Mark}.
    \item Psychological Stress: One of the most major constraints includes stress related to dealing with complicated projects and teams. However, project managers should be skilled in managing their own stress as well as supporting the well-being of their team\cite{Project_Management_Techniques}.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section{Conclusion and Futureworks}
\subsection{Improvements}
The thesis underscores the criticality of ongoing self-improvement for project managers, highlighting the necessity to harmoniously balance and rejuvenate across multiple facets: physical well-being, mental acuity, spiritual fulfillment, and social-emotional health. It elaborates on the importance of effectively managing stress, proactively nurturing personal well-being, and achieving a harmonious work-life equilibrium. These aspects of continuous personal and professional growth are not just beneficial but essential for project managers to maintain their effectiveness, resilience, and capability to handle the multifaceted demands and challenges inherent in their roles\cite{Patterns}.

\subsection{Limitations}
Although this study is comprehensive, it has some limitations that need to be considered. The use of self-reported data from project managers may introduce bias. Moreover, the interviews and case studies referenced in the study represent different industries and project scopes, which may affect the generalizability of the findings. To improve the study, future research could aim to include a larger and more diverse sample size and consider the impact of different organizational cultures and structures on project management success\cite{Project_Management_Techniques}.

\subsection{Conclusion}
This study sheds light on the essential habits required for successful project management. It emphasizes the significance of personal interactions, strategic planning, prioritization, and valuing individuals over processes. Additionally, it calls attention to the detrimental effects of micromanagement and public criticism. These findings highlight the importance of balancing technical skills with behavioral competencies to achieve effective project management. The insights provided in this study can be used as a guide by current and aspiring project managers to improve their leadership skills and to encourage further research in varied contexts and organizational cultures.

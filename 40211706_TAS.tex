\section{Introduction}
Project management operates as a dynamic "living system" within the broader "autopoietic organization" of a company, following its intricate internal dynamics to ensure project success. At its core are project managers who, through a unique language comprising technical-operative modality and mindset, navigate both Adaptive and Predictive project lifecycles. As noted by Akbar Azwir, external factors like government decisions can significantly impact projects, necessitating a focus on building strong project resilience \cite{Lorenzo, Daniele}.\\

In this rapidly evolving project management landscape, the traits and behaviors of effective project managers emerge as critical factors influencing project outcomes. This study delves into the essential habits that contribute to project management success, recognizing that organizations must adapt to unprecedented challenges and opportunities. The exploration includes habits such as effective communication, strategic decision-making, planning acumen, risk management proficiency, stakeholder engagement, and overall project execution prowess. By unraveling the intricacies of project management within the context of organizational dynamics, the research aims to shed light on these habits that empower project managers to navigate crises successfully and deliver projects effectively.

\subsection{Motivation}
In the age of disruptive technologies, global connectivity, and changing customer expectations, project management is no longer merely imperative but rather a strategic necessity. This research intends to reveal the habits responsible for the success of projects so that they can be used to guide novice project managers while helping organizations enhance their project management.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
Project management is a key element determining organizational success, but the specific behaviors that typify successful project managers are ambiguous. These habits are not precisely known resulting in possible disagreements and poor leadership that will not offer proper risk avoidance procedures. The importance of clarity on such key habits cannot be overemphasized in a dynamically changing business environment. The purpose of this study is to address the gap in existing knowledge, which is critical for improving current project management methods that are aligned with the changing needs of modern projects. These results will be of much value to the organizations that aim for successful project outcomes and individual project managers.


\subsection{Objective}
This research seeks to analyze and document the habits of successful project managers systematically. This way we hope to bring out the skills and behavior that make them good leaders. This study is designed to assist upcoming and accomplished project managers in acquiring practical lessons that can help formulate their professional growth plan as well as reform project management strategy in the organizations. In essence, the study intends to participate in a larger debate on what makes for effective project management, thereby serving individual professionals, teams, and organizations seeking better outcomes.

\section{Background Material}

\subsection{Interpersonal Skills and Communication in Project Management}
Effective communication and interpersonal skills are not just supplementary but central to the success of project management. These skills are crucial for establishing and maintaining positive relationships with team members, stakeholders, and clients, which are fundamental traits for success in this field \cite{Interpersonal_skills}.\\\\
Effective communication involves not only conveying information but also actively listening and understanding the needs and feedback of others. Project managers with strong interpersonal skills can effectively manage complex team dynamics, resolve conflicts, and ensure clear communication, which is vital for project cohesion and success. Emotional intelligence, which encompasses self-awareness, empathy, and social skills, further enhances a project manager's ability to lead effectively \cite{Warner_Mark}.\\

\subsection{Project Leadership and Team Building}
Effective leadership in project management goes beyond mere oversight of tasks. It involves inspiring, guiding, and mentoring team members. Successful project managers understand the strengths of each team member and align them with project objectives.\\
\\This approach not only enhances individual performance but also fosters a sense of belonging and purpose within the team. Leaders who invest in team development create a culture of continuous improvement and learning that is crucial for adapting to changing project demands. Strong team leadership ensures that each member is engaged and contributes to the project's success in a meaningful way\cite{Project_Management}.


\subsection{Adaptability and Problem-Solving}
In today's world, project management is constantly evolving, which means that those who are successful in this field need to have strong problem-solving skills and the ability to adapt quickly to new challenges. This could be due to technological advances, changes in market conditions, or any obstacles that arise within a project. \\\\It's not enough for project managers to simply change their plans; they need to do it efficiently and effectively to limit disruptions and maintain the project's momentum. To solve problems in this context, managers often need to think creatively and come up with innovative solutions that work within the project's constraints.\cite{Project_Management_Leadership}


\subsection{Ethical Decision-Making and Integrity}
Integrity and ethical decision-making are fundamental to the long-term success of projects and the reputation of the managing organization. Project managers often face a variety of ethical dilemmas, ranging from resource allocation to stakeholder engagement and conflict of interest scenarios. \\\\It is crucial for project managers to make decisions that adhere to a strong ethical framework, as this is essential for maintaining stakeholder trust and ensuring project sustainability. Ethical principles and their practical application in diverse project environments have gained increasing attention, underscoring the need for managers to be well-versed in this aspect of project management\cite{Project_Management_Techniques}.


\newpage
\section{Methods \& Methodology}
\subsection{Research Approach}
The study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative research methodologies to gain a deeper understanding of the habits that distinguish successful project managers. By utilizing statistical analysis and in-depth qualitative insights, the study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of these habits.
\subsection{Quantitative Analysis}
As part of the research, we will analyze existing studies and surveys related to project management success. The analysis will focus on identifying common traits and habits among successful project managers. Additionally, we will explore the correlations between specific habits and project outcomes. Empirical studies and industry surveys will serve as the sources for this data.\cite{relationship_between_project_manage}
\subsection{Qualitative Analysis}
The study includes a qualitative component involving interviews and case studies. Interviews will be conducted with experienced project managers to gain personal insights into the habits and traits that contribute to their success. \\\\In addition, successful project management instances will be analyzed through case studies to identify common habits and approaches. These narratives will offer a more detailed understanding of the practical applications of these habits in different project contexts\cite{Project_Management}.
\subsection{Ethical Considerations}
In conducting interviews and case studies, we will strictly adhere to ethical considerations such as informed consent, confidentiality, and the right to withdraw. This aligns with the ethical leadership traits crucial for successful project management\cite{Project_Management_Techniques}.
\subsection{Data Analysis}
Both quantitative and qualitative data sources will be analyzed to identify patterns and commonalities in the habits of successful project managers. This analysis will be crucial in developing a comprehensive understanding of the key factors that contribute to project management success. Any spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors have been corrected.

\section{Results Obtained}
\subsection{Under what conditions:}
The study revealed that specific circumstances had a significant impact on the efficiency of project managers.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Highly Collaborative Environments: Project managers were most successful in teams where open communication and collaboration were fostered, especially in those with a strong culture of trust and mutual respect.
    \item Dynamic and Changing Project Scenarios: In fast-paced and ever-changing work environments, project managers who possess exceptional adaptability and problem-solving skills are highly valued. These individuals have the ability to quickly and efficiently modify plans and strategies as needed, allowing them to excel and achieve success even in the face of frequent changes. Their capacity to navigate dynamic situations with ease enables them to lead their teams with confidence and produce exceptional outcomes\cite{relationship_between_project_manage}.
    \item Ethical and Transparent Cultures: In organizations with a strong ethical framework and clear communication channels, projects led by managers who prioritize ethical decision-making and transparency tend to have higher success rates. This is because such managers are more likely to foster a culture of trust and accountability, which in turn leads to better collaboration and more effective problem-solving. Additionally, by being transparent about their decision-making processes and involving team members in important decisions, these managers can help to ensure that everyone is aligned and working towards the same goals. Ultimately, this approach can lead to better outcomes for the organization as a whole, as well as increased job satisfaction and engagement among team members. Projects led by managers who prioritize ethical decision-making and transparency tend to have higher success rates, especially in organizations with a strong ethical framework and clear communication channels\cite{Project_Management_Techniques}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{constrains}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Resource Limitations: One of the most typical problems for a project manager is trying to succeed under restricted resources. For example, this includes lack of funds, scarcity of human capital, and shortage of time. Resource management and creative problem-solving in the face of those limitations are important characteristics of effective project management\cite{relationship_between_project_manage}.
    \item Communication Barriers: Communication barriers may be caused by diverse team compositions, especially in remote or international projects. Therefore, it is important for project managers to master the communication techniques to ensure these gaps are bridged\cite{Warner_Mark}.
    \item Psychological Stress: One of the most major constraints includes stress related to dealing with complicated projects and teams. However, project managers should be skilled in managing their own stress as well as supporting the well-being of their team\cite{Project_Management_Techniques}.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section{Conclusion and Futureworks}
\subsection{Improvements}
The research has revealed several key areas that require improvement in project management practices. It is crucial to focus on enhancing communication strategies, particularly in diverse and remote teams. The development of adaptive leadership skills that can effectively respond to changing project dynamics is also emphasized. Additionally, the significance of ongoing training and development in ethical decision-making is evident. This ensures that project managers are equipped to handle complex ethical dilemmas\cite{Warner_Mark}

\subsection{limitations}
Although this study is comprehensive, it has some limitations that need to be considered. The use of self-reported data from project managers may introduce bias. Moreover, the interviews and case studies included in the study represent different industries and project scopes, which may affect the generalizability of the findings. To improve the study, future research could aim to include a larger and more diverse sample size and consider the impact of different organizational cultures and structures on project management success\cite{Project_Management_Techniques}.

\subsection{Conclusion}
This study makes a significant contribution to understanding the habits necessary for successful project management. It highlights the importance of effective communication, adaptive leadership, ethical decision-making, and emotional intelligence. The findings provide valuable insights for both current and aspiring project managers and offer a framework for organizations to develop these skills in their project management teams. The research identifies critical challenges faced by project managers, such as resource constraints and stakeholder resistance, offering a foundation for future studies to build upon\cite{relationship_between_project_manage}.
